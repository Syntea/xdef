3.2.1.2, 2019-01-21
=================== 
- corrected backward compatibility of the validation type declaration in
 the X-definition version 2.0 (the keyword "parse:")
- corrected the bug if the missing element in the model is followed by
  optional elements which are also missing.
- corrected the bug in construction mode. It was not invoked the
  initialization section in the section "var" in the X-script of 
  an element model.
