  not contain a time zone and the default time zone is set, then this default
  time zone is set to the result datetime value.
* Implemented the new X-script method `currencyCode()` of `Currency` value which
  returns string with ISO 4217 currency code.

# Version 42.1.0, release-date 2024-01-15
* Added the new binary operator `CHECK`. The result of an operation is 
  a `ParseResult` value. The type of the first operand must be `Parser` or
  `ParseResult` (if it is Parser then the parsing method is invoked so that it
  results from a `ParseResut` value). The second operand is a `boolean`
  expression (usually it is method) and it is invoked only if the `ParseResult`
  from the first processed operand does not contain any error messages. If the
  result of the invoked expression of the second operand is false, the error
  message `XDEF822: Parsed result does not fit to CHECK argument` is set to the
  `ParseResult` value.
* Fixed bug in nested sequence groups.
* If the type of a value in X-component is `union` and types of all items are
  compatible type, then the type of getter/settter is set according to that

* ==================================================================
* NOTE this version implements some new features prepared for version 41.0.0:
* ==================================================================
* added the Java method `rule.validate(String)` to X-script of `BNFRule` objects.
  Result of this method is a `boolean` value.
* added new Java method to `XDDocument`:
  * `XDParseResult parseXDType(String typeName, String data)`
  this method invokes a validation method from declared type in X-definition
  and returns `XDParseResult` object.
* added new X-definition type of value: `GPSPosition`.
    * Methods with this object:
        * `latitude()` returns GPS latitude in degrees (-90.0 to 90.0).
        * `longitude()` returns GPS longitude in degrees (-180.0 to 180.0).
        * `altitude()` returns GPS altitude in meters.
        * `name()` returns name of GPS position or null.
        * `distanceTo(GPSPosition x)` returns distance to GPS position `x` in meters.
    * Constructors (latitude, longitude, altitude are float numbers, name is a string):
        * `new GPSPosition(latitude, longitude)`
        * `new GPSPosition(latitude, longitude, altitude)`
        * `new GPSPosition(latitude, longitude, altitude, name)`
        * `new GPSPosition(latitude, longitude, name)`
* added new XML validation method `gps` (The Java implementation is in class
  `org.xdef.sys.GPSPosition`). The required form is:
  `(latitude, longitude[, altitude[, name]])`
  where parameters `latitude`, `longitude`, `altitude` are numbers and `name`
  is a string either containing only letters. Otherwise it must be quoted.
  After the comma separator is one space. Examples:
    * `(51.52, -0.09, 0.0, London)` or
    * `(51.52, -0.09)` (altitude and name not specified).
* added new X-definition type of value `Price`
  (the Java implementation is in class `org.xdef.sys.Price`).
    * Constructor:
        * `new Price(amount, code)`
          where `amount` is a number and `code` is a ISO 4217 currency code. 
    * Methods with this object:
        * `amount()` returns amount of currency as decimal number.
        * `currencyCode()` returns ISO 4217 currency code.
        * `fractionDigits()` returns recommended number of fraction digits or -1.
        * `display()` returns string with printable form of currency (i.e. decimal
          number with recommended number of decimal digits, space and
          ISO 4217 currency code).
* added new XML validation method `price`. The required form is:
  * `(decimal_number code)`; e.g. `(12.25 USD)`.

# Version 40.1.2, release-date 2021-02-15
* corrected the bug in the X-script method `s.contains(s)`.
* corrected the bug in the construction node of JSON.
* corrected the bug in JSON parser: duplicated name in object not reported.
* corrected the bug in JSON parser: after decimal point and before decimal point
  must be a digit.
* to `org.xdef.XDDocument` it is implemented the new method
  `Object jcreate(String name, ReportWriter reporter)`.
  This method allows to construct JSON data acccording to JSON model with given
  name. The method returns constructed JSON object.
* to `org.xdef.proc.XXNode` it is implemented the new method
  `public void setJSONContext(Object data)`.
  This method sets the context with JSON data used in the construction mode.
* to the BNF grammar are implemented new inline functions `$skipToNextLine`,
  `$UTFChar`, and it is implemented the possibility to specify case insensitive
  terminal symbols (when the terminal symbol specification follows percentage
  character).
* if in the date and datetime validation method is specified any of constraining
  facets `%minInclusive`, `%maxInclusive`, `%minExclusive` or `%maxExclusive`,
  then it is now skipped the test of date validity (which can be set
  by properties or by methods `setMinDate` or `setMaxDate`).
* the method `setBufIndex(int)` in the class org.xdef.sys.StringParser was
  renamed to `setIndex(int)`.
* implemented new version of transformation of XML to JSON and of JSON to XML.

# Version 40.1.1, release-date 2020-09-17
* corrected bugs in BNF syntax of X-definitions
* implemented the new method `chkCompatibility(String version)` to XDPool.
  This allows to check the version of `XDPool` object with the actual
  X-definition software.
* in the class `org.xdef.KDOMUtils` is implemented new static method
  `public static void removeRedundantXmlnsAttrs(Element el)`. This method
  removes unused `xmlns` attributes and moves repeatable used xmlns attributes
  to the element el.
  This method is now invoked in the construction mode of X-definition on the
  constructed element.

# Version 40.1.0, release-date 2020-08-04
* corrected bug illegal type in `ObjectReader` when the code contains an item
  with `uniqueSetKey`.
* in the X-script was implemented the new type `uniqueSetKey`. This type of
  object enables to save the actual value of the key of an `uniqueSet`. To do it 
  you can invoke the new implemented method `getActualKey()` from `uniqueSet`
  object. With the new method `resetKey` from `uniqueSetKey` the actual key
  of given `uniqueSet` object is set to the saved value. E.g.:
  ```xml
  <NodeValue xd:script=
    'var uniqueSetKey k; init k=nodeSet.getActualKey(); finally k.resetKey();'>
  ...
  ```
* implemented the new X-script method `bindSet(uniqueSet u1[,uniqueSet u2...])`.
  This method can be specified only in the `init` section of the X-script
  of model of Element. At the end of processing of the element where it was
  invoked it sets to all specified `uniqueSet` parameters the value of the
  actual key from the init time (it happens after `finally` event).

# Version 40.0.2, release-date 2020-06-22
* improved generation of X-definition from XML data in
  `org.xdef.util.GenXDefinition`.
* the utility `org.xdef.util.GUIEditor` now supports also JSON data.
  of date time values. Eg.: `Mon May 11 23:39:07 CEST 2020`.
* corrected bug in v `org.xdef.XDFactory` when for the compilation of
  X-definition is specified a `org.xdef.sys.ReportWriter` of other type
  then `org.xdef.ArrayReporter`.
* corrected bug in parsing method `xdatetime` by mask with variants when
  the simpler variant precedes the more complex one.
* in X-script implemented new validation method `SHA1`.
* in X-script implemented new validation method `printableDate` for the
  printable format.
* implemented new X-script type of variable `uniqueSetKey` which holds the key
  of an item in `uniqueSet` table.
* in X-script is implemented new method `getActualKey` on `uniqueSet` objects.
  The result of this method is object uniqueSetKey which holds the actual item
  in the `uniqueSet` table (i.e. after invoking methods `ID`, `SET`, `IDREF`,
  `CHECK`).
* in X-script is implemented new method `resetKey` of `uniqueSetKey` objects.
  This method sets the actual value of key to the value which is saved
  in the `uniqueSetKey` object.

# Version 40.0.1, release-date 2020-05-15
* improved error reporting.
* corrected bug when a JSON string value contains some of escape characters.
* The default value of property xdef_warnings was changed to true.
* The parameters with the type Class in the method `org.xdef.XDFactory.compileXD`
  are deprecated.

# Version 40.0.0, release-date 2020-04-24
* new implementation of processing of JSON data.
* `xd:def` may now contain attribute `xd:importLocal` (the list of X-definition
  names from where are imported local declarations).
* xd:root may refer also to named xd:choice.
* corrected bug in error reporting (in some special cases was incorrect `xpath`).
* corrected bug in invoking methods from referred types.
* to the class `org.xdef.XDFactory` are implemented methods `writeXDPool`
  and `readXDPool`.
* in X-script is implemented method `getCreateContextElement` which in
  the construction mode returns the actual element from context, otherwise it
  returns null.
* the default scope of accessibility of items from the `xd:declaration` declared
  as child of `xd:def` is now local (in previous versions it was global).
* to xd:def element is no possible to write the attribute `importLocal`. The
  value of this attribute is the comma separated list of names of X-definitions
  from which are imported items from local xd:declarations (the `noname`
  X-definition is specified by the character `#`).
* NOTE that the implementation of JSON is preliminary, it may be changed in
  future versions.

# Version 32.5.6, release-date 2020-02-15
* implemented possibility of processing of JSON data in X-definition. This
  version is preliminary to the version 40.0.0 (the documentation of JSON usage
  will come with the version 40.0.0).

# Version 32.5.5, release-date 2019-12-17
* implemented new X-script method String `getEnv(String name)` which reads
  an environment variable.
* it is now possible to use environment variables likewise as properties.
  The property item has priority. If there are specified both, the environmental
  variable and the property item, then it is used the property value instead of
  value of the environmental variable. The names of properties and environment
  variables are changed, the dots (`.`) in a names are replaced by
  underlines (`_`), e.g. `_xdef.debug_` is now `_xdef_debug_`
  (see `org.xdef.XDConstants`).
  However, since the names with dots are deprecated, they are still accepted.
* corrected bug when it is specified attribute `_xd:text_` and a text node
  follows the last one element in a sequence.
* corrected bug when in types `_union_` or `_list_` are references to declared
  types.
* corrected bug in processing of elements with `_xd:textcontent_` attribute.
* reports error if xpath expression is empty string or null.
* corrected bugs in construction of elements with `_xd:text_` attribute.

# Version 32.5.4, release-date 2019-11-17
* corrected bug that in the section `onStartElement` were ignored some errors
  reported by methods of `uniqueSet`.
* corrected bug in X-components where are used the validation methods `xdType`.

# Version 32.5.3, release-date 2019-10-22
* improved the utility `org.xdef.GUIEditor`. Added parameter the `-g`
  which enables to create X-definition from given XML data

# Version 32.5.2, release-date 2019-10-09
* corrected `org.xdef.sys.SDatetime` methods implemented from
  `javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar`
* the parameters with sources of X-definitions and the items of the attribute
  `xd:include` of root elements `xd:def` or `xd:collection` may contain the file
  names with wildcard character `*` or `?`.
  E.g.:
  ```java
  XDPool xp = XDFactory.compileXD(props, "classpath://xxx.yyy.a*.xdef");
  ```
  or
  ```xml
  <xd:collection xmlns:xd = "..." xd:include = "classpath://xxx.yyy.a*.xdef"/>
  ```
  
# Version 32.5.1, release-date 2019-09-25
* Corrected `org.xdef.sys.SDatetime` methods implemented from
  `javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar`.
* implemented the access to XML data or X-definition data with
  an URL-like form where the protocol name is `classpath`.
  E.g.:
  ```java
  String urlName = "classpath://org.xdefimpl.compile.XdefOfXdefBase.xdef";
  ```
  This form may be used to parse XML source data:
  ```java
  Document dom = KXmlUtils.parseXml(urlName);
  ```
  or to X-definition in compilation of XDPool:
  ```java
  XDPool xp = XDFactory.compileXD(null, urlName);
  ```
  or in the attribute `xd:include` in header of X-definition:
  ```xml
  <xd:def xmlns:xd ="http://www.xdef.org/xdef/3.2"
    xd:include = "classpath://org.xdefimpl.compile.XdefOfXdefBase.xdef,
      classpath://org.xdefimpl.compile.XdefOfXdef20.xdef,
      classpath://org.xdefimpl.compile.XdefOfXdef31.xdef" 
  > ...
  ```
  
# Version 32.5.0, release-date 2019-09-16
* Prepared the version for processing of JSON data.
  The X-component interface has now new method to Json which returns a JSON
  object (i.e. `java.util.Map` as JSON object or `java.util.List` as JSON array).
  It is also now available the new class `org.xdef.json.JsonUtil` which
  enables to work with JSON objects (conversion JSON to XML, XML to JSON,
  parsing of source JSON data, compare JSON objects etc.).
  In the X-definition will be possible in future to describe structure
  of JSON models.

# Version 32.4.0, release-date 2019-04-02
* when X-component is generated from an element model where are no attributes
  and it has just a text child node, there are also generated getter/setter
  methods which have the `$` set before the name of element (e.g. get$name()).
* the namespace URI for the X-definition version 3.2 is changed
    * old: `http://www.xdef.org/3.2`
    * new: `http://www.xdef.org/xdef/3.2`
  The old value is also accepted (because of compatibility reason).

# Version 32.3.2, release-date 2019-03-24
* fixed error in generation of X-components from models where there are more
  nested models with the same name.

# Version 32.3.1, release-date 2019-03-21
* fixed errors in generation of X-components from models with namespace URI

# Version 32.3.0, release-date 2019-03-12
* to the X-script added method
    XDValue replaceItem(int index, XDValue value)
  This method is member of the Container objects
* fixed errors in conversion of X-definition to XML schema (in declared types)

# Version 32.2.1, release-date 2019-02-25
* fixed X-component bug when the prefix of the attribute namespace differs
  from the prefix in the model. The method toXml() returns not then correct
  result
* now is available the technology of X-lexicon (see the document
  xdef-32_Lexicon.pdf)

# Version 32.1.3, release-date 2019-02-04
* corrected bug in the construction mode. The initialization of variables
  in the X-script section "var" in the model of element was not invoked
  correctly
* corrected setting of stop addresses in the GUI of debugger
* X-definition validation methods with the prefix `xs:` are deprecated. You can
  use the name without this prefix (ie. `xs:string` should be `string`)

# Version 3.2.1.2, release-date 2019-01-21
* corrected backward compatibility of the validation type declaration in
  the X-definition version 2.0 (the keyword `parse:`)
* corrected the bug if the missing element in the model is followed by
  optional elements which are also missing
* corrected the bug in construction mode. It was not invoked the
  initialization section in the section `var` in the X-script of 
  an element model
